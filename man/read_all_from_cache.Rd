\title{Read all datafindr cache files from a metawoRld project}
\usage{
read_all_from_cache(
  type = c("assessment", "extraction", "metadata"),
  metawoRld_path
)
}
\arguments{
\item{metawoRld_path}{The path to the metawoRld project directory, which
contains the datafindr cache subdirectory.}
}
\value{
A named list. The top-level names are the sanitized identifiers found
in the cache. Each element is itself a list containing the parsed data,
named by the type ("assessment", "extraction", "metadata"). Returns an
empty list (\code{list()}) if the cache directory doesn't exist or no valid
cache files are found.
}
\description{
Scans the datafindr cache directory within a metawoRld project, reads all
valid cached JSON files (assessment, extraction, metadata), parses them,
and returns them organized in a nested list.
}
\details{
The function identifies files matching the pattern
\verb{<sanitized_id>_<type>.json} within the \code{assessment}, \code{extraction}, and
\code{metadata} subdirectories of the datafindr cache. It attempts to parse each
valid file as JSON. Files that cannot be parsed or do not match the naming
convention are skipped with a warning.
